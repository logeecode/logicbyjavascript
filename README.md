This repo is for store javascript common question logic on interview.
The question must be insert in this file with title and question itself, then you must code the solution in index.js file

## List of question
<span>1.</span> Mumbling<br/>
   ```
    Create a function called mumbling with string parameter then return like this example below:

    mumbling("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
    mumbling("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
    mumbling("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
   ```
<span>2.</span> Square Every Digit<br/>
  ```
    You are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them

    For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 9^2 is 81 and 1^2 is 1.
   ```
<span>3.</span> Running out of space<br/>
  ```
    Kevin is noticing his space run out!

   Write a function that removes the spaces from the values and returns an array showing the space decreasing. For example, running this function on the array ['i', 'have','no','space'] would produce ['i','ihave','ihaveno','ihavenospace'].
