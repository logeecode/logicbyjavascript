## List of question
<span>1.</span> Mumbling<br/>
   ```
   Create a function called mumbling with string parameter then return like this example below:

    mumbling("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
    mumbling("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
    mumbling("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
   ```
<span>2.</span> Square Every Digit<br/>
  ```
   You are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them

    For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 9^2 is 81 and 1^2 is 1.
